DeeBot is an IRC bot which uses the DeeIRC framework for connectivity and events. DeeBot has a plugin system which allows new features to be easily added.

It is currently in the early stages and does nothing due to lack of plugins, but functions fine otherwise. There is a basic administration plugin and a debug plugin.
